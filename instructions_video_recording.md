### **Project Presentation (Video Recording)**  

For the final project, each group must submit a **5-minute video presentation**. This video will serve as your group's opportunity to showcase your work and share your findings with the class.  

You are encouraged to be creative with your presentation. The simplest and most effective approach is to create a **slide deck** as a team and record a group presentation using **Zoom** or similar tools. Each group member **must participate** and **speak** during the presentation.  

#### **General Guidelines**  
1. **Webcam Usage**: We strongly recommend enabling webcams during the recording so your team members are visible in the video.  
2. **Time Management**: Stick to the 5-minute limit. Practice beforehand to ensure your key points fit within the time frame.  
3. **Audio and Video Quality**: Make sure the recording is clear, with good audio and visuals.  
4. **Team Effort**: Coordinate with your teammates to create a cohesive and engaging presentation.  

### **Suggested Structure for the Video Presentation**  

You are not required to follow this structure rigidly, but it provides a strong starting point for most projects:  

1. **Problem Statement**  
   - Clearly state the problem your project addresses.  
   - Explain the **motivation** behind the problem. Why is it important?  
   - Define the **inputs** and **outputs** of the problem.  

2. **Technical Challenges**  
   - Highlight the **key technical challenges** of the problem.  
   - What makes solving this problem difficult or interesting?  

3. **Related Work**  
   - Provide a brief overview of **existing solutions** or previous approaches.  
   - Highlight gaps or limitations in these works that your project addresses.  

4. **Your Approach and Results**  
   - Explain your **technical approach** and any innovations introduced by your team.  
   - Present your **evaluation results**:  
     - Describe the **datasets** and **metrics** used.  
     - Emphasize **important findings** (e.g., unexpected results, key takeaways).  
     - Compare your results with prior work if applicable.  

5. **Broader Impact**  
   - Discuss the **impact** of your work:  
     - How can others use your findings?  
     - What are the limitations of your approach?  
     - What future improvements or extensions could be made?
