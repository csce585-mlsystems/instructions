## Project Summary/Abstract  
### A short summary of the project (3–5 sentences maximum).  

## Problem Description  
- Problem description: Include a concise problem description (2–3 sentences). Can be mathematical or textual.  
- Motivation  
  - Motivation 1  
  - Motivation 2  
  - Motivation 3  
- Challenges  
  - Challenge 1  
  - Challenge 2  
  - Challenge 3  

⚠️ Note: Please do not include more than 3 bullet points per section.  

## Contribution  
- [`Replication of existing work`]  
- [`Extension of existing work`]  
- [`Novel contribution`]  

Please select one or multiple tags that apply. Example:  
### [`Replication of existing work`], [`Extension of existing work`]  
We use paper_1 [citation] to reproduce their results. We improve their method as follows:  
- Contribution 1  
- Contribution 2  

Note: This has no impact on your grade as long as you properly follow the procedure (e.g., problem identification, motivation, method, discussion, results, conclusion). Choosing [`Novel contribution`] will not give you any advantage over [`Replication of existing work`].  

## References  
### `BibTeX` of all references used in the project. Can be included as a `references.bib` file in the repo.

# < The following is only applicable for the final project submission >  

## Dependencies  
### Include all dependencies required to run the project. Example:  
- Python 3.11  
- Ubuntu 22.04  

For Python users: Please use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as your package manager instead of `pip`. Your repo must include both the `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files.  

## Directory Structure  
Example:  
```
|- data (mandatory)
|- src (mandatory)
|   |- model.py
|   |- example.py
|- train.py
|- run.py (mandatory)
|- result.py (mandatory)
```

⚠️ Notes:  
- All projects must include the `run.<ext>` script (extension depends on your programming language) at the project root directory. This is the script users will run to execute your project.  
- If your project computes/compares metrics such as accuracy, latency, or energy, you must include the `result.<ext>` script to plot the results.  
- Result files such as `.csv`, `.jpg`, or raw data must be saved in the `data` directory.  

## How to Run  
- Include all instructions (`commands`, `scripts`, etc.) needed to run your code.  
- Provide all other details a computer science student would need to reproduce your results.  

Example:  
- To train the model, run:  
  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```  
- To plot the results, run:  
  ```bash
  python result.py
  ```  

## Demo  
- All projects must include video(s) demonstrating your project.  
- Please use annotations/explanations to clarify what is happening in the demo.
