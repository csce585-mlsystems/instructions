# CSCE 585 — Course Project Rubric  
**Instructor:** Pooyan Jamshidi  
**Course:** Machine Learning Systems (Fall 2025)  
**Total Points:** 100 (+10 bonus)  

The course project is divided into three milestones (P0, P1, P2) that progressively build toward a full ML systems experiment.  
Each milestone focuses on a critical stage of the research workflow: defining a problem, setting up experiments, and conducting and communicating results.

---

## Milestone P0 — Project Proposal and Motivation (20 points)  
**Due:** Week 4  

| Criterion | Description | Points |
|------------|--------------|-------:|
| Problem Definition | Clear statement of the problem, relevance to ML systems, and expected contribution. | 5 |
| Motivation and Context | Why is this problem important? Is it grounded in real-world needs, literature, or system-level challenges? | 5 |
| Feasibility and Scope | The proposed work is achievable within the semester and includes measurable goals. | 5 |
| Clarity and Writing Quality | The proposal is well-organized, clearly written, and free of ambiguity. | 5 |
| **Total** |  | **20** |

**Evaluation Guidelines:**  
- Excellent (18–20): Clear, original, and well-motivated proposal grounded in ML systems literature.  
- Satisfactory (13–17): Understandable but missing depth or clear motivation.  
- Poor (0–12): Vague, infeasible, or unrelated to ML systems.

## Milestone P1 — Initial Experiment and Evaluation Setup (20 points)  
**Due:** Week 8  

| Criterion | Description | Points |
|------------|--------------|-------:|
| System / Dataset Setup | Correct installation, dataset selection, and justification of environment and platform choices. | 5 |
| Baseline Implementation | Working baseline or reference pipeline with justified selection. | 5 |
| Preliminary Experiment | Early experiment showing initial results or trends motivating the full study. | 5 |
| Documentation and Reproducibility | Code organization, README, run instructions, and reproducibility (seed control, versioning). | 5 |
| **Total** |  | **20** |

**Evaluation Guidelines:**  
- Excellent (18–20): Reproducible setup, meaningful preliminary experiment, clear documentation.  
- Satisfactory (13–17): Functional setup but lacks clarity or completeness.  
- Poor (0–12): Setup incomplete or results unclear.

## Milestone P2 — Final Report and Presentation (60 points)  
**Due:** Week 15  

| Criterion | Description | Points |
|------------|--------------|-------:|
| Experimental Rigor | Comprehensive experiments with appropriate baselines, ablation studies, or scaling analysis. | 20 |
| Result Analysis and Insight | Deep analysis with well-designed visualizations and interpretation of system behavior. | 15 |
| Discussion and Limitations | Critical reflection on limitations, challenges, or future extensions. | 5 |
| Final Report Quality | Clear writing, logical organization, proper citations, and integration with related work. | 10 |
| Presentation / Demo | Clear and engaging summary of motivation, method, and results in oral or video format. | 10 |
| **Total** |  | **60** |

**Evaluation Guidelines:**  
- Excellent (54–60): Technically strong, insightful, well-communicated work.  
- Satisfactory (42–53): Solid work with some missing analysis or clarity issues.  
- Poor (0–41): Incomplete or weak analysis, unclear communication.

|------------|--------------|-------:|
| Innovation or Deployment | Novel idea, open-source release, or real-world deployment beyond basic requirements. | 3 |
| Collaboration and Effort Balance | Equal and well-documented contributions from all team members (via commits, logs, or records). | 3 |
| Community Impact | Broader contribution such as dataset release, open-source integration, collaboration with another team, or external engagement. | 2 |
| Technical Excellence | Exceptional engineering quality, creativity in design, or outstanding evaluation depth. | 2 |
| **Total** |  | **10** |

## Grading Notes
- Teams are expected to use GitHub for version control, experiment tracking, and documentation.  
- Reports should follow clear scientific writing conventions (motivation → method → results → discussion).  
- Late submissions may receive partial credit only if properly justified.  
- Collaboration should be transparent and well-documented in project commits or notebooks.  
- Strong projects are encouraged to turn their results into short papers, blog posts, or open-source releases.  
- Bonus points recognize exceptional creativity, depth, and contribution beyond the standard requirements.
